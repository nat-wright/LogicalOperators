Lists are similar to arrays except they are dynamic.
Lists need to have the using System.Collections.Generic; at the top of the script
You declare the list by writing List<>
name.Add()
A list holds variables in a certain order
Lists have a dynamic size while arrays have a fixed size
Arrays can be added to a list with the AddRange function
Remove can be used to remove an item from a list
RemoveAt can be used to specify the item you want to remove
AddRange can join lists together
Lists can easily be used with loops
